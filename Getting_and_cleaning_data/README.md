<h5>Project Description</h5>
This project is aimed to explore [R] packages for getting and cleaning data.<br>
The data is collected using smartphones leveraging its sensors on board.

<h6><u>Task to perform:</u></h6>
<ol><li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.</li>
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li></ol>
<br>
The run\_analysis.R is the code for cleaning the data as per the task given.<br>

How to use the run\_analysis.R?
<ol><li>Clone this repository: git clone <a href="https://github.com/gunaranjan/Getting_and_cleaning_data.git">https://github.com/gunaranjan/Getting\_and\_cleaning\_data.git</a>
<br><li>Download compressed <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"> raw data</a>.The raw data are obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository<br>
<li>Copy the files (data & run\_analysis.R) to the current working directory of R.<br>
<li>Open R console and fire the command source("run\_analysis.R")<br>
<li>The output data will be present in your current working directory of R in the name tidy_data.txt.<br>
