Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation
    mad(): Median absolute deviation
    max(): Largest value in array
    min(): Smallest value in array
    sma(): Signal magnitude area
    energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
    iqr(): Interquartile range
    entropy(): Signal entropy
    arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
    correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
    maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
    meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
    skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal
    kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
    bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
    angle(): Angle between some vectors.

No unit of measures is reported as all features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The script does the following activites and transforms the variables.
<ol><li>Extract training and test data sets
<li>Merge the Traning and test data sets
<li>Extract mean and standard deviation variables
<li>Use descriptive activity names
<li>Label variables appropriately
<li>Create a tidy data set
</ol>

The Tidy data is mean of the means that were calibrated during the experiment.
